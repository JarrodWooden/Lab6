Make a Robot Move using the MSP430 and pulse Modulation... For experts, make robot move based on button presses from an IR Remote

This information was recieved from this url: www.hobbytronics.co.uk/h-bridge-driver-sn754410

Because the datasheet was not very helpful with a general overview on how it actually works and should connect to our robot and MSP430

"H-Bridge Motor Driver 1A - SN754410

Faster, cheaper, smaller, better, right? The SN754410 Quad Half H-Bridge is just that. Capable of driving high voltage motors using TTL 5V logic levels, the SN754410 can drive 4.5V up to 36V at 1A continuous output current!

For even higher current applications, it is possible to physically stack two devices on top of each other to get almost 2 A of drive current.

The SN754410 is a quad half H-bridge IC. This allows the chip to either control 4 motors in one direction using the 4 half H-bridges or to control 2 motors in both directions using a full H-bridge for each motor.

The following shows the connections for controlling 2 motors in either direction using 2 full H-bridges."
